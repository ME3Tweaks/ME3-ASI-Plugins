# Garbage Collection Forcer ASI
This ASI will make the garbage collector run more often in Mass Effect 3. v1.0 of this ASI mod runs every 8 seconds while the Armor Locker is open. For this to have any effect the OnPawnAppearanceChanged() method in the SFXHandler_Personalization class in SFXGame needs to be patched to do nothing. This patch is automatically applied by ALOT Installer V4.
